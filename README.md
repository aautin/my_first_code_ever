# my_first_code_ever

Back to 2023's winter, I was studying in law at the University. Got burned out real quick, I announced to my family at Christmas Eve I quit and to reassure them I also said "I'm developping things on my computer, nothing really serious but still"."

Back home, alone, with no idea about where I'm going to, I discovered Python and I followed a pdf course about this language.
At the end of few weeks of study (mostly chilling and sleeping), I had the idea to create this project : re-code a simple Snake game!

It doesn't work well at all, it's actually a disaster in the result and in the way it's implemented, but a music background is here, a score appears, my code is kinda "documented" and the game is playable for few seconds (lmao).

This is where everything began.
